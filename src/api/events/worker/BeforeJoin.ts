/**
 * Emitted before a player successfully or unsuccessfully joins a room on the
 * server.
 *
 * This event allows you to redirect the player to another game, or to completely
 * prevent them from joining.
 *
 * A better event to use for when a player has successfully joined a room is
 * the [`player.join`](https://skeld.js.org/classes/core.playerjoinevent.html)
 * event.
 *
 * @example
 * ```ts
 * .@EventListener("worker.beforejoin")
 * onWorkerBeforeJoin(ev: WorkerBeforeJoinEvent) {
 *   for (const [ netId, mod ] of ev.client.mods) {
 *     if (mod.modid === "com.andruzzzhka.customserversclient") {
 *       ev.cancel();
 *       return ev.client.disconnect("Do not join with custom servers client!!!");
 *     }
 *   }
 * }
 * ```
