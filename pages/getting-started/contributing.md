## Auto setup
Hindenburg has a built-in script if you want to setup all of the below development features:
```sh
yarn setup:dev
```

> You will likely have to run this everytime you update Hindenburg, in particular if you use re-install dependencies.

### Using a local version of SkeldJS

> Remember to build your SkeldJS packages after making any changes!
